                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: >
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and

                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at

                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.

                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322


                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:


                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to

                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

                If the signing server's response is anything other than successful, such

                as with an authentication failure or bad request, the HTTP status code

                and response are hidden due to the --silent flag passed to cURL.


                Drop the stdio redirect to the output file along with the --silent flag,

                and instead use the -o parameter to output the response to the

                appropriate file on success. This allows the status code and response to

                be shown in the logs upon failure.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is fixed
                upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being used.

                When unlocking LUKS devices, udev events initializing the DM devices are
                still

                generated in the background even after cryptsetup luksOpen returns. We need to

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression ratio.

                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI partition).

                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA" UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="resin-rootA" PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as a fallback

                method to identify devices.

                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option, but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD is also

                missing.

                Generate a bmap file from the sparse image to allow for punching holes

                in the disk image ranges that were unmapped after building. This data is

                lost during compression, and the bmapfile allows for recreating,

                writing, and verifying the sparse image.

                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts

                        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.


                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be

                        considered.

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                        timeout too in 15 seconds:


                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.
