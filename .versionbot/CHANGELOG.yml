                The os-helpers scripts are meant to be sourced by other scripts, not

                executed. When sourced, the shebang should be ignored.


                However, we have seen instances where a bash script sourcing a sh

                os-helper scripts triggers POSIX behaviour, specifically glob parsing

                failures.

              body: >
                When a user runs the flasher with secure boot enabled in `config.json`,

                the public keys used to validate the bootloader are enrolled. If any

                other bootloader signature fails to validate against this public key, it

                won't be executed.


                If the user attempts to run the balenaOS flasher on that system again

                without first enabling the secure boot option, the flasher won't enroll

                keys, but the installed system will be signed. This will result in a

                secure boot enabled system without full-disk encryption.


                Bail out in this case so the user must choose to explicitly opt-in to

                secure boot for the new installation, and full-disk encryption along

                with it. Otherwise, the user must reset the enrolled keys to install

                without secure boot.

                Extended globbing is not enabled by default, which makes the substring

                match for trimming leading zeroes not work. This causes SETUPMODEVAR to

                evaluate to "01", which fails comparison with the string "1", skipping

                key enrollment when secure boot is enabled. Compare using an integer

                expression instead.

                When refactoring secure boot setup, a logic mistake in the purpose and

                use of SECUREBOOT_VAR meant that devices booting the flasher with keys already

                enrolled would bail out with an incorrect message about secure boot not

                being supported in firmware.


                This variable is `00` on systems with secure boot support in firmware,

                but not enabled and enforced, `01` on systems where secure boot is

                enforced, and empty when secure boot is unsupported.


                Change this conditional to bail out only when the variable is empty,

                indicating that secure boot is unsupported.

                        Accordingly, move the swtpm service to a separate compose file that is

                        only used when secure boot is enabled.

                get_dev_path_from_label() calls lsblk to get the name and label of a

                disk, then filters the list using the label and returns a /dev path.


                The name returned when using a luks encrypted partition is the

                /dev/mapper name, rather than the kernel's device mapper name under

                /dev/dm-*. When assembling a path under /dev using the luks name, the

                path is invalid, and the by-state links aren't created.


                This leads to the rootfs hook failing to find and mount the resin-rootA

                partition.


                Change the attribute retrieved using lsblk to kname to fix this.

                If the image is not signed, the key enrollment will fail, and the

                flasher will enter a loop trying to enroll them and rebooting.


                Instead, skip the key enrollment if the image is not signed, resulting

                With secure boot enabled boot and EFI partition are split apart.

                During rollback-health, when bind-mounting inactive root to run

                old hooks from, the EFI partition must be bind-mounted as well

                otherwise the /mnt/boot/EFI symlink is invalid and rollback fails

                to deploy files into that directory.

                This allows for the testbot to set resin_flasher_skip=0
                in the extra_uEnv.txt file of the flasher image and
                bypass the boot switch detection mechanisms used for
                specific private device types.

                The boot pins would otherwise prevent the flasher
                from running if they were set to the eMMC position.

                The flasher extra_uEnv.txt file overrides any resin_flasher_skip
                value previously configured by the device integration layer.

                In v2.108.0 we did a major NetworkManager upgrade as we started using

                meson as a build system. The connectivity check feature was left

                disabled, which is a regression and it produces fake results.


                This commit enables it back.


                Fixes #2964.

              body: >
                iptables takes a file lock at /run/xtables.lock. By default, if

                the file is locked, iptables will fail with error. When that happens,

                the iptables rules won't be configured, and the shared mode

                (for which we use iptables) will not be setup properly.


                Instead, pass "--wait 2", to block.


                The included patch has to be removed once we upgrade to next

                NetworkManager version as it is already included upstream.

                The previous method of disabling NTP by stopping the nameserver

                (dnsmasq) relied on the dnsmasq unit not being reactivated before the

                test completed.


                Instead, disable NTP by blocking ntp.org in the local dnsmasq instance

                using a dbus method call. NTP is re-enabled as before, by restarting

                dnsmasq.

              hash: 345d1440d34fe042f03884c4ae32f0ba7e7768e8
              body: >
                In rare cases (believed to be caused by a non-atomic file creation and

                writing operation in containerd), we end up with an empty file at

                `/mnt/data/docker/containerd/daemon/io.containerd.grpc.v1.introspection/uuid`.

                This causes `ctr version` (and hence the health check) to fail. See

                https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/322


                This commit addresses this issue in two ways:


                1. Before running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file exists and is
                   empty. If so, we remove it. (The subsequent execution of `ctr
                   version` by the healthcheck will create the file again.)
                2. After running `ctr version`, we check if the uuid file was really
                   created and is not empty.

                In both cases, when an empty uuid file is detected, we log the event to

                help us confirm our hypothesis about the root cause.

                If the signing server's response is anything other than successful, such

                as with an authentication failure or bad request, the HTTP status code

                and response are hidden due to the --silent flag passed to cURL.


                Drop the stdio redirect to the output file along with the --silent flag,

                and instead use the -o parameter to output the response to the

                appropriate file on success. This allows the status code and response to

                be shown in the logs upon failure.

              hash: aeab6a6b030bd6d0047a92dcc8d41fd9e542ffe7
              body: >
                Main NetworkManager recipe was migrated to match latest one from

                meta-openembedded, so that all improvements are merged now.


                Excluded from it are `iwd` and `dhcpcd` daemon configurations that are

                not used by us.


                Default NM firewall in meta-openembedded is `nftables` where we are still

                using `iptables`.


                The new recipe relies on `meson` as a build system now.


                The .bbapend file that contains modifications specific to balena is preserved.

                Only `balena-client-id.patch` is removed as it references code that no longer

                exists. This is because the internal systemd DHCPv4 client code that NM used

                is now replaced by nettools' n-dhcp4 implementation.


                Closes #2872

                Current resolvconf version is broken for kirkstone, which is fixed
                upstream,

                so we reuse the fixed version from upstream.


                The symptom is that DNS servers provided by DHCP are not being used.

                wait for the udev processing to finish before killing udev and cleaning up

                the udev database to avoid having to deal with partially initialized devices

                or corrupted udev database in the target OS.

                Our initramfs is built into the kernel, which is always compressed.

                Disable redundant initramfs compression, which should save some CPU

                cycles during build and boot, as well as improving compression ratio.

                In the current state the cryptsetup initrd script tries to unlock all

                LUKS volumes in the system using the TPM. This includes user-defined LUKS

                volumes that, if present, fail to unlock and make the system unbootable.

                We should also not touch user-defined volumes in the first place.


                This patch modifies the cryptsetup script to only unlock LUKS volumes

                that are on the OS drive (same block device as the EFI partition).

                Partitions in flasher images are being created with different LABEL and

                PARTLABEL, for example:

                ```

                /dev/sdd2: LABEL="flash-rootA" UUID="5585296a-c183-4b10-89ae-20607e5604be" TYPE="ext4" PARTLABEL="resin-rootA" PARTUUID="582478f2-be4b-4279-9124-536385c9551d"

                ```


                This commit fixes the inconsistency as the PARTLABEL is used as a fallback

                method to identify devices.

                Enabling CONFIG_KERNEL_ZSTD=y improves the compression ratio compared

                to gzip while being faster to decompress. With kernel 5.15 in balenaOS

                v2.105, we see the 24 MB kernel compress to approximately 19 MB.


                Zstd support was added in commit 48f7ddf, first introduced in kernel

                v5.9. Enable this config unconditionally in supported kernels.


                Note that not every architecture and device support this option, but in

                those cases, Kconfig will automatically disable it as HAVE_ZSTD is also

                missing.

                        This reverts commit eb69ff445fe0cac4f2060e67fa6994e61c3ca4b9.


                        Hardcoding the bridge address like this results in conflicts

                        when multiple instances are running on one jenkins node.


                        A new solution for local workstation testing will have to be

                        considered.

                        interval,

                        let's reduce it to 30 times because the resolveLocalTarget which we call will

                        timeout too in 15 seconds:


                        https://github.com/balena-os/leviathan-worker/blob/master/lib/helpers/index.ts#L162


                        So reducing the retries number to 30 will effectly bring the total combined timeout to a maximum of 8 minutes.

                Given that testbot devices use a tunnel to specific ports to communicate

                with the DUT that is established with the suite-generated keys, using

                a different keypair for the ssh-auth test would require to tear down and

                re-establish the tunnel.


                It's easier to just use the existing key pair in the ssh-auth test.

                Using two set of keys, the one created by the suite to authenticate by

                the proxy and a new custom key, is tricky as when running on testbot the

                key is used to establish the tunnel between core and DUT.


                Revert this change in preparation to removing the custom key and

                modifying the tests to use a single key.


                This reverts commit b24d92774a67cf0c0b83a29848bdcf6ed8a574db.
